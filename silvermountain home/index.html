			  &nbsp Acrobatics is a groundbreaking book all about paragiliding acro... Colorfully designed with inspiration images, Acrobatics takes you step-by-step through each manoeuvre using both written description and photo sequence. Which is created by an expert team, it is the perfect book for new and intermediate acro pilots.			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
			 &nbsp Acro is somewhat freestyle by nature, and there's no list of 'allowed' stunts. Wuth a bit of creativity and an abundance of skills, pro pilots are often coming up with new maneuvers that challenge their abilities. <br> If you understand the inherebt risks with acro paragiliding and you still wish to proceed, the next step will depend on your current trenning.  </p>
			 
			 <p>
			&nbsp There is no doubt that acro is more dangerous than regular paragiliding. Acrobatic pilots are typically those with extensive experience and well-develoment wing skills, who are seeking to push  their limits. With sort of trenning , the risks can diminish to a level that some pilots deem acceptable. 	Remember that acro is generally considered an extension of regular paragiliding, and is not something that should be jumped into due to a desire to impress your friends. 	</p>
